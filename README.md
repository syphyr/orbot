Orbot is a free VPN and proxy app that empowers other apps to use the internet more securely. Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.

Orbot is a crucial component of the Guardian Project, an initiative  that leads an effort
to develop a secure and anonymous smartphone. This platform is designed for use by human rights
activists, journalists and others around the world. Learn more: <https://guardianproject.info/>


Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe that Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the usage instructions and
learn to configure it properly. Learn more: <https://torproject.org/>

### Build Instructions

Orbot is built with [hev-socks5-tunnel](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel). Before you can build Orbot, you'll need to clone the submodule
for this dependency. Once cloned, Android Studio + Gradle will take care of building the C code.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot-android
```

Or, if you already cloned the repo:

```bash
cd orbot-android
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
