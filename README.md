Orbot is a free VPN and proxy app that empowers other apps to use the internet more securely. Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.

Orbot is a crucial component of the Guardian Project, an initiative  that leads an effort
to develop a secure and anonymous smartphone. This platform is designed for use by human rights
activists, journalists and others around the world. Learn more: <https://guardianproject.info/>


Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe that Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the usage instructions and
learn to configure it properly. Learn more: <https://torproject.org/>

### Build Instructions

Orbot can be built with `gradlew` or Android Studio like most every other Android app. However these steps listed below need to be completed once before Orbot can be built successfully.

#### Use Java 25 Toolchain For Java+Kotlin Projects

Orbot now uses Java 25 which is the latest Java LTS replacing the Java 21 LTS we had been using for some time.

If you are unable to build Orbot becuase you don't have Java 25 installed/configured, or even if you aren't sure which version of Java is being used, run the script `update-gradle-jvm.sh` once from the root of the repository to be able to configure Java 25 for Orobt's Gradle project.

```bash
# navigate to Orbot's repository
cd orbot-android
# in repository root, run:
./update-gradle-jvm.sh
```

This creates a file  `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` which specifies that we are to use version 25 of the Java toolchain. The script then uses the new gradle feature `./gradlew updateDaemonJvm` to automatically populate the file with additional details Gradle uses to obtain the corect Java 25 Toolchain for your machine (OS and CPU architecutre) and to automatically use this new toolchain in subsequent builds of Orobt.

After this is done, you should be able to build Orbot again using either in Android Studio or via the command line:

```bash
# clean project and generate a debug APK of the app
./gradlew clean assembleFullpermDebug
```


#### Obtaining `hev-socks5-tunnel` Native Code Dependency

Orbot is built with [hev-socks5-tunnel](https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel). Before you can build Orbot, you'll need to clone the submodule
for this dependency. Once cloned, Android Studio + Gradle will take care of building the C code.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot-android
# you should be good to go building Orbot
cd orbot-android 
# build a debug APK of orbot
./gradlew assembleFullpermDebug
```

Or, if you already cloned the repo:

```bash
cd orbot-android
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
# build a debug APK of orbot 
./gradlew assembleFullpermDebug
```

If, sometime later, you pull new commits to Orbot an and see that there are changes to `app/src/main/jni/hev-socks5-tunnel` that means that the `hev-socks5-tunnel` version we use in Orbot has been updated. You will have to update to the new version of `hev-socks5-tunnel` by running:

```bash
# update to the new version of hev-socks5-tunnel Orbot uses
git submodule update --init --recursive

# you should no longer see that there are changes to hev-socks5-tunnel in git...
git status 
```

### Viewing Logs 

Recently `tor` was added to be its own Linux process on Android instead of having it run within the primary app process. That measn that you will no longer see logs from `tor`, `OrbotService`, `OrbotVPNManager` etc within Android Studio. In order to see these logs you can use:


`adb logcat  --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s "org.torproject.android.debug") -v color` to see the app logs in your terminal

`adb logcat  --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s "org.torproject.android.debug:tor") -v color` and to see the `tor` process logs.

**There is a helper script to get both of these logs printed side-by-side with `tmux`. From the root directory run:

```bash
./scripts/view_logs_tmux.sh
```

You may need to initially do some configuration to obtain `tmux` and add `adb` to your `PATH`:

```bash
# on Mac OS 
brew install tmux 


# on debian + friends:
sudo apt intstall tmux 

# then make sure adb is in your path in your .bashrc or similar file:
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools


# on mac you do the above or instead get an adb instance from brew...
brew install android-platform-tools
```
